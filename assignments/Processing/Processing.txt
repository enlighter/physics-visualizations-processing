I have a  question to be done using Processing Language:-
 

The question is about several balls moving around the display window and rebounding off the edge. For higher grades, you are required to add the following functionalities –
 
a. Fading of the balls while moving
b. Ensure that, at the time of generation, none of the balls overlap
c. Utilize collideWith(Ball other) method provided to implement collision of balls with each
other.


 

An implementation using Classes would be much simpler and logical.

 
Each ball has the following characteristics –
 
1.      diameter(between 20 and 80 pixels)

2.      color(random)

3.      location (random, but such that the entire ball is within the window)

4.      speed in x and y directions (each speed component is a random value between 0.1 and 2.0)

5.      additionally for fading, it has –

                      a. opacity and
                      b. speed of fading

 

The number of balls that are generated are between 5 and 20.

I would prefer it in processing.
The solution is:-
